# Details
This application is a beginner PHP application. The main purpose is to learn how to use the API, then to learn how to pull and print data. First of all, it is useful to read the documentation on the http://ergast.com/mrd/ site to get information about the API and to examine the https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_1 page to understand the F1 logic. Then you can implement the application by making connections and doing a lot of research.
By adding the 3rd page, how can the top 5 of the race be estimated based on the qualifying laps on this page. At the same time, Pit Stop Duration times are also written on the table.When accessing the .htaccess file without the need for the index.php page, the page was automatically redirected and viewing the file directory was blocked.
